## User Story

 ```As a child, I want to learn new things in a fun and interactive way, so that I can enjoy the process of learning and remember what I've learned.```

## Acceptance criteria

The Learning Lab should meet the following criteria:
* The platform should have a home page with links to different subjects available for learning.
* The Maths section should present users with questions and answer options, and provide feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
* The English section should provide users with a search bar so that they can look up definitions, synonyms and a random word so that users can expand their vocabulary, sourced from the Word API.
* The Learn More section takes users to explore another page with a library amd other subjects. The Library section should allow users to borrow books to read or just listen. Users should also be able to write a review and make notes. Open Library API should display relevant results. 
* The journal page should allow users to create notes and save them locally on their device.
* The avatar selector should allow users to choose an avatar to represent them on the platform, and display their selected avatar and name throughout the site.
* The platform should be responsive and accessible on multiple devices and screen sizes.

From there, you can use the navigation links to explore the different subjects available for learning. The Maths, English, and Learn more sections each have their own pages with interactive features. The Journal and Avatar Selector pages are accessible from the (navigation) bar at the top of the screen. Enjoy learning and taking notes with The Learning_Lab!

## Challenges

- Netlify could be difficult at times; Builds would often fail and the logs were not always helpful. With a bit of research, we managed to fix it by adding a _redirect file to the root of the project. After implementing this, the build was succesfull. 


## Successes

- A well organised team! We had two minor git merge conflicts. I believe this was partly due to how well we organised the workload. Even towards the end of the project when we were working on the same files, we always communicated well to make sure no conflicts would likely occur.

- We settled on our application idea before the first project lesson. We all wanted to do something educational, and while that changed slightly after initial plans, we were all passionate about what we were creating


## Future Development

* Add more content to make our website accessible to learners from Early Years to KS4.
* Cater to the needs of our dedicated educators with a dedicated teacher domain for personalized assignments, group management, and tailor-made resources for easy planning and downloads.
* Integrate the learning platform with popular LMS systems used by schools, such as Blackboard or Canvas, in addition to a dedicated teacher domain.
* Create domains for schools to have their own personal account. This will help teachers select appropriate topics for special groups of students based on their interests and learning style, using data from quizzes and other assessments.
* Translate scores on quizzes and time spent learning into rewards based on the school's behavior policy, such as house points, merits, and badges, to encourage engagement and motivation.
* Enhance the platform's offerings and appeal to a wider range of learners by incorporating more interactive content, such as simulations, games, and videos.
* Expand the selection of books by adding more authors to enhance the platform's offerings and appeal to a wider range of learners.
